# Book Store Web Application

This repository contains the code for the Book Store web application, which consists of both the client-side and server-side components.

## Client Side

The client-side of the application is built using Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS. It provides the user interface for browsing and interacting with the book store.

### Technologies Used:
- Vite
- React
- Tailwind CSS

## Server Side

The server-side of the application is built using MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js. It provides the backend functionality for managing books in the database and handling HTTP requests from the client-side.

### Technologies Used:
- MongoDB
- Express.js
- Node.js

## Installation

### Client Side
1. Navigate to the `client` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

### Server Side
1. Navigate to the `server` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Replace the MongoDB URI in the `server.js` file with your own username and password.
4. Run `npm start` to start the server.

## Usage

Once both the client-side and server-side servers are running, you can access the Book Store web application in your web browser. The client-side server typically runs on port 3000, and the server-side server runs on the specified port (default is 5001).
